# java-network-simulator
Created a 2D network simulator that can simulate and illustrates some of the important protocols of TCP/IP-based computer networks. The system demonstrates the transmission of a message (long enough to show the intended protocols) from a host to another host via a collection of routers with user interaction. Used Slick library for the 2D models and animations.
